THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: ORACLE OF AGES / SEASONS
Sound Guide by HelpTheWretched
------------------------------

Oracle of Ages & Oracle of Seasons have far more recycled sound effects - sounds that are used for more than one purpose - than any other Legend of Zelda game. In the descriptions on www.ZeldaSounds.com, many of the common alternate uses of some sounds are listed. To save space in these descriptions, some of the less notable uses have been removed and written in this more complete listing.

These recycled sound files are named by what I've considered to be the primary use for them. If a sound appears only (or primarily) in one of the two games, its prefix is "OOA" or "OOS" - all other sounds have the prefix "Oracle".

Several of these sounds are very similar to some from Link's Awakening, but after close inspection I've found that they have slight differences in either tone, volume, or pitch. The technical notes from Link's Awakening also apply to the Oracle games!
